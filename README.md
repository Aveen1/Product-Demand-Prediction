# Product-Demand-Prediction

A company that sells a product intends to reduce its prices during the approaching holiday season. The company desires to determine the optimal price that will make its product a more attractive option than its rivals. To accomplish this, the company has furnished a dataset that includes information on previous variations in sales as a result of changes in price. I develop a model that can forecast the demand for the product at various price points in the market.

The provided dataset contains details on:
the product ID
the store ID
the total price at which the product was sold
the initial price at which the product was sold
the number of units sold (quantity demanded).
